notes:
Artificial Intellegence is an unique filtering algorithm, that is duplicated threw the various parts or members and join each other, this algorithm depends on a database, memory or library of strutured packages, it external inputs, internal inputs and its feedbacks gives a result.
There are three parts of the artificial machine there is the algorithm, the database and the result.
Q&A:
Question is if humans follow the same logic, that is do humans follow also a algorithm common to all other human, and the difference is only the database acquired by enheritance and learned threw experience ?
And is it possible to alter and make more eficient this algorithm, and how is this data structure saved and its characteristics ?

The turing machine, moore and mealy model was an attempt to determine this algorithm, but since machine and reality are independent, it is hard to make a machine function obeying reality principles and laws, just the act of this interface is a challenge.
To make things easy is to iniciate only in the psychomotor arena, creating its library of motion then apply the magic algorithm creating robotic tranducer interface machine action.

LFSM - Learning Finite State Machine

A machine that is tought by the user, using a non programmable language but by real interaction.
It can be a progressive consistent acumulator of usefull knowlegde.
