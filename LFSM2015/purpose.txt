This project is aimed for industry use, it is basicaly a step by step learning finite sate machine and logic circuit, these are 
written in pages in diferent created objects and with thier interaction able to imulate any type of automation, this will be the 
fundamental block of code, then will create other blocks of code on modules that will interact or interconnect with this principle 
one such has timers, counters, etc.

This will rapidly facilitate developement of prototype machinary, and the aim is to first assembly the entire machine with all 
sensores, motores, etc. connected to this block and only after installation do step by step teach what the machine to do, the 
interaction of the inputs and outputs are memorized and respective reply that is inserted by the user, when complete, the code
will be stored in a memory for mass production.

In a way it will acessible to any user, because of its live interaction with the device created and the imagination of the 
user to define its reaction to the inputs, not necessary a bagage of programming, and it will fit easily in the electrical 
environment because it follows teh electrician way of thinking.

This is emulateed in the PC but to be coded in MCU, try it on on PC using number has inputs, note that object with page 
inferior to 256 will behave has logic, and above 255 has state machine that is sequencial circuits, so have a pen in your 
hand draw a mealy or more circuit program it in then it will follow, inputs not programmed are ignored or bypassed.
